This repository contains several libraries for building OpenID Connect (OIDC) native
clients. The core IdentityModel.OidcClient library is a certified OIDC relying party and
implements [RFC 8252](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252/), "OAuth 2.0 for native
Applications". The IdentityModel.OidcClient.IdTokenValidator provides validation of Id
Tokens based on the Microsoft JWT handler: 
[IdentityModel.OidcClient.IdentityTokenValidator](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IdentityModel.OidcClient.IdentityTokenValidator),
and is distributed as a separate package in order to prevent certain dependency problems.
Finally, IdentityModel.OidcClient.DPoP adds [DPoP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9449) 
extensions to IdentityModel.OidcClient for sender-constraining tokens.

## Samples
OidcClient targets .NET Standard, making it suitable for .NET and .NET
Framework. It can be used to build OIDC native clients with a variety of .NET UI tools.
The [samples repository](https://github.com/IdentityModel/IdentityModel.OidcClient.Samples)
shows how to use it in 
- .NET MAUI
- WPF with the system browser
- WPF with an embedded browser
- WinForms with an embedded browser
- Cross Platform Console Applications (relies on kestrel for processing the callback)
- Windows Console Applications (relies on an HttpListener - a wrapper around the windows HTTP.sys driver)
- Windows Console Applications using custom uri schemes
